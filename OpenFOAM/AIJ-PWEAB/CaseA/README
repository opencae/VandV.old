1. Prerequisites
================

Gnuplot utility are required in order to run the case.

2. What is this?
================

This case solves benchmark test case A defined in AIJ guidelines for
practical applications of CFD to pedestrian wind environment around
buildings [1] following the benchmark procedure.

3. Running the case
===================

In order to run the case:

* Type ./Allrun. This script will automatically make mesh, perform
   CFD calculation. Type ./Allrun -m for the calculation with
   residual monitoring. 

* After the run, you will find profileU.eps and profilek.eps which
  compare the OpenFOAM results with those of a wind tunnel test [2].

* Type ./Allclean to clean up the case directory and reset to the
  initial state.
