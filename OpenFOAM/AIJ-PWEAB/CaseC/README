1. Prerequisites
================

Gnuplot and the setDiscreteFields utility are required in
order to run the case. setDiscreteFields is available at:
http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_setDiscreteFields

2. What is this?
================

This case solves benchmark test case C defined in AIJ guidelines for
practical applications of CFD to pedestrian wind environment around
buildings [1] following the benchmark procedure.

3. Running the case
===================

In order to run the case:

* Type either ./Allrun or ./Allrun -parallel for serial or 4 processor
  parallel run.

* After the run, you will find plotHorizontalU.png which will compare
  the OpenFOAM results with those of a wind tunnel test. 

* Type ./Allclean to clean up the case directory and reset to the
  initial state.
