2. Prerequisites
================

Python, Gnuplot and the setDiscreteFields utility are required in
order to run the case. SetDiscreteFields is available at:
http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_setDiscreteFields


3. What is this?
================

The case solves benchmark test case B formulated in AIJ guidelines for
practical applications of CFD to pedestrian wind environment around
buildings [1] following the benchmark procedure, using several RANS models.
The summary of the solutions are presented in the reference [2] along with
solutions of other test cases of the guideline.

As the case is a collection of steady state RANS simulations, the
computational domain is cut in half at the symmetry plane (the y = 0
plane) where the symmetryPlane boundary condition is applied.


4. Running the case
===================

The sub-case using each RANS model has distinct subdirectory with the
RANS model name. Running either ./Allrun or ./Allrun -parallel under
the top directory allows the sub-cases to be run all at once in serial
or in 4 processor parallel respectively. Each sub-case can be run
individually as well by running the same commands under each sub-case
directory.

After the run, you will find horizontal_U_<RANSModel>.eps (where
<RANSModel> is the name of the RANS models) which compares the
OpenFOAM results with those of a wind tunnel test in each sub-case
directory. The figure will be plotted with the measuring point numbers
in x-axis reordered so that it will be compatible with Fig. 2-3-17 of
the reference [1]. Likewise, you will also find
verticalProfile_[Uk]_<RANSModel>.eps which plot vertical profiles of
velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. The formats of the figures are
compatible with Figs. 2-3-7 -- 2-3-14 of the reference [1].

Run ./Allclean under the top directory to clean up everything and
reset to the initial state, or run the same command under each case
subdirectory to clean individually.
