1. Manifest
===========

README          This file.
Allrun          The driver script to run all sub-cases.
Allclean        The driver script to clean up all sub-cases.
*deg            Sub-case that solves the problem under wind direction
                of that.
mesh            Directory where the mesh will be generated.
share           Sharable materials

2. Prerequisites
================

Convert, gnuplot and the setDiscreteFields utility are required in
order to run the case. setDiscreteFields is available at:
http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_setDiscreteFields

3. What is this?
================

This case solves benchmark test case D defined in AIJ guidelines for
practical applications of CFD to pedestrian wind environment around
buildings [1] following the benchmark procedure.

4. Running the case
===================

In order to run the case:

* Type either ./Allrun or ./Allrun -parallel for serial or 4 processor
  parallel run. This script will automatically make mesh in mesh
  directory and perform calculations with three inflow wind directions
  in corresponding directories, i.e. 0deg, 22.5deg and 45deg.

* After the run, you will find plot.pdf in *deg directories.
  Thesefigures compare the OpenFOAM results with those of a wind
  tunnel test[2].

* Type ./Allclean to clean up the case directory and reset to the
  initial state.
