1. Manifest
===========

README          This file.
Allrun          The driver script to run all sub-cases.
Allclean        The driver script to clean up all sub-cases.
NNE             Sub-case that solves the problem under wind direction NNE.
W               Sub-case that solves the problem under wind direction W.
mesh            Directory where the mesh will be generated.
share           Sharable materials

2. Prerequisites
================

Gnuplot and the setDiscreteFields utility are required in
order to run the case. setDiscreteFields is available at:
http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib_setDiscreteFields

3. What is this?
================

This case solves benchmark test case E defined in AIJ guidelines for
practical applications of CFD to pedestrian wind environment around
buildings [1] following the benchmark procedure.

4. Running the case
===================

In order to run the case:

* Type either ./Allrun or ./Allrun -parallel for serial or 4 processor
  parallel run. This script will automatically make mesh in mesh
  directory and perform calculations with two inflow wind directions
  in corresponding directories, i.e. NNE and W.

* After the run, you will find velocityThermistorWithPlotOrder.eps and
  velocityWithPlotOrder.eps in NNE and W directories. These figures
  compare the OpenFOAM results with those of a wind tunnel test. These
  figures will be plotted with the measuring point numbers in x-axis
  reordered so that it will be almost compatible with Figure 4 of the
  reference [2]. Please note that point No.47 was excluded in the
  figures because this point locates inside a building in the mesh
  which snappyHexMesh utility generates.

* Type ./Allclean to clean up the case directory and reset to the
  initial state.
